# hello-world
First day of the rest of mah liffee!!!

Hello I'm James. A recent graduate with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I thought that I would like this field, and for a while I believed myself. After 2 years though, I know for a fact that I should have and was born to be a programmer.

I will not let this regret well up inside of me. I will get this done.
